[...] NLP tasks:\\xa0The self-attention mechanism enhances the linguistic capabilities of machine learning models by allowing the efficient and complete analysis of an entire text. Research has shown advancements in sentiment classification.6 Models can perform NLP tasks well because the attention layer allows it to compute the relation between words regardless of the distance between them.7 [...] Self-attention played a key role in the advancement of LLMs by enabling parallelization within training examples. This method is useful because the longer the\\xa0sequence length, the more memory constraints limit batching across training examples. Using self-attention, LLM training data can be split into batches and processed concurrently on multiple GPUs.1 Self-attention reduces the computational power needed to train machine learning models with efficient batching processed in parallel.',\n",

It does this by giving attention scores to words based on how relevant they are to others in the sequence. This way, the model can focus on the most contextually important information.

In other words, the self-attention mechanism enables the model to weigh the importance of different elements in an input sequence and dynamically adjust their influence on the output. This is especially important for language processing tasks, where the meaning of a word can change based on its context within a sentence or document. [...] In this section, we are adapting the previously discussed self-attention mechanism into a causal self-attention mechanism, specifically for GPT-like (decoder-style) LLMs that are used to generate text. This causal self-attention mechanism is also often referred to as “masked self-attention”.

We then extended this concept to multi-head attention, the widely used component of large-language transformers. After discussing self-attention and multi-head attention, we introduced yet another concept: cross-attention, which is a flavor of self-attention that we can apply between two different sequences. This is already a lot of information to take in. Let’s leave the training of a neural network using [...] To overcome this issue, attention mechanisms were introduced to give access to all sequence elements at each time step.
