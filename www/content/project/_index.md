<!-- **Project Assignment: Building an AI-Powered Business Solution** -->

This semester-long project involves the development of a Document-Driven Agentic Intelligence System (DAIS) designed to operate on a specified business-relevant document corpus. Students will build a system capable of ingesting and processing PDF and text documents, utilizing a multi-agent architecture for analysis, and supporting both an interactive chat interface for human users and a batch query interface for automated evaluation. The system’s performance will be rigorously assessed through a student-constructed test set and quantitative metrics.

The project allows students to choose one of three variations, each focusing on a distinct analytical approach. These include building a semantic knowledge graph, functioning as a research advisor capable of providing evidence-backed responses, or acting as a scientific/business discovery assistant proposing hypotheses. Regardless of the chosen variation, the system must be designed with a specific user persona in mind – such as an equity analyst or compliance officer – and should support realistic tasks associated with that role.

The development process is structured around several milestones, culminating in a demonstrable system. Students will progressively build upon a basic data pipeline, integrating document ingestion, agentic processing, and evaluation frameworks. The final deliverable requires a fully functional, deployed system accessible through both interfaces, alongside a comprehensive technical report, a demonstration video, and an in-class presentation.
