## Design Document Outline

### 1. Requirements Document

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the project and its objectives.
2. **Functional Requirements**: List the necessary features and functionalities of your Gen AI solution. For example:
   - The system must be able to process natural language inputs.
   - The system should provide personalized recommendations based on user data.
3. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Include aspects like performance, security, and usability. For instance:
   - The system must respond to user queries within 2 seconds.
   - The system should ensure data privacy and comply with relevant regulations.
4. **User Interface Requirements**: Describe the desired user experience and interface elements. For example:
   - The system should have a user-friendly chat interface.
   - The system should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 2. Prioritized User Stories

1. **Format**: Use the format: "As a [user type], I want to [perform some task] so that [I can achieve some goal]."
2. **Prioritization**: Prioritize user stories based on their importance and complexity. Use techniques like MoSCoW method (Must-Haves, Should-Haves, Could-Haves, Won't-Haves) or Kano model.
3. **Example User Stories**:
   - As a customer service manager, I want to integrate the AI chatbot with our existing CRM system so that I can track customer interactions more efficiently.
   - As a customer, I want to receive personalized product recommendations based on my purchase history so that I can find relevant products quickly.

### 3. Roadmap

1. **Project Timeline**: Create a timeline that outlines major milestones and deadlines.
2. **Phases**: Break down the project into phases (e.g., research, development, testing, deployment).
3. **Key Deliverables**: Identify what needs to be delivered at the end of each phase.

### 4. Tasks

1. **Task Breakdown**: Break down each phase into specific tasks. For example:
   - Research phase: Conduct market analysis, gather user feedback.
   - Development phase: Develop AI model, integrate with CRM.
2. **Task Assignment**: Clearly assign tasks to team members based on their skills and strengths.

### 5. Responsibilities and Roles

1. **Team Roles**: Define roles within the team (e.g., project manager, developer, designer).
2. **Responsibilities**: Clearly outline the responsibilities for each role. For example:
   - Project Manager: Oversees project timeline, ensures tasks are completed on time.
   - Developer: Develops and tests the AI model and integration.
   - Designer: Designs the user interface and user experience.
