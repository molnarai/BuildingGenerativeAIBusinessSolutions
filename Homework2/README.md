# Instructions for Homework 2:

- Go to the **Assessments** tab in iCollege and click on **Assignments** to find the **Homework 2** assignment and further instructions to the assignment.

- After logging in to the new IFI cluster git clone the repo to your home directory via:

  **git clone git@github.com:molnarai/BuildingGenerativeAIBusinessSolutions.git**

- Switch to the **BuildingGenerativeAIBusinessSolutions/Homework2** folder.

- Make a copy of the homework notebook and rename the copy using your GSU username as suffix:

    **AgenticAI_RAG_Homework2_<YOUR GSU USERNAME>.ipynb**

- Use the **MSA8700 Python 3.12** kernel when you execute your noterbnook cells! This kernel has all the necessary Python packages already installed. You do not have to install any packages. Do **NOT** use any of the other kernels. 

- Work with your renamed copy to create your solution and all the necessary .txt files that will be generated and submitted with your notebook. 

- Complete all cells in the notebook i.e. replace missing fields (abbreviated with **'...'** in the code cells below) with your code cells, run the notebook and create the 6 necessary .txt files. 

- Run the tests to confirm that your .txt files were generated. Finally, submit your .txt files and your executed .ipynb notebook by running the two submission steps at the very end of the notebook.
