HAT DO YOU REMEMBER
about our trip to Paris?” I ask
Sonia, my wife, as I admire
the passing blue, purple, pink,
and yellow wildflowers on
State Highway 101. We went
to France in the fall of 2008 just before I
proposed. It was a long weekend of
delicious meals and no set plans. She chose
a purple scarf when I took her shopping. I
bought a baguette to bring back to our
hotel room, where she was sleeping off jet
lag. She mentions none of this.
“You were tense,” Sonia says.
That’s right, I remember, I did feel tense.

The spontaneous trip to Paris was
compensation for insecurities I couldn’t
begin to articulate, much less address, back
then. I imagined going to Paris for a few
days would make the prospect of spending
a lifetime with me more attractive.
Now, in advance of what will be 15 years of
increasingly happy and self-aware
marriage this November, we are headed
back to Paris—sort of. I am whisking Sonia

the western edge of the Piney Woods. And
this time, we’re going to enjoy ourselves.
I don’t know what to expect from Paris,
Texas. Is it a tourist town leaning into try-
hard Paris-but-not-France jokes or just an
ordinary rural Texas town? As it turns out,
neither. Paris, Texas, is something much
better. Unlike many aspirational names
chosen for Texas towns in hopes they
would become a New London or a second
Athens, this Paris supposedly got its name
because it was the furthest thing from the
world’s most thriving city at the time.
Despite the historically comic misnomer,
this Texas town is thriving by embracing
the absurdity.

We only have a few hours before the VIP
reception at the wine festival, so we take in
as much of Paris as an afternoon affords.
We pop into the modern Paris Bakery,
where the menu offers French dip
sandwiches, croissants, baguettes, and
French wines, but also something called a
cowboy cookie. I get one of those, as well
as a baguette. Old habits, you know.

An entire wall of the bakery is decorated
with an old map of downtown. The city
burned down to the bricks in 1916 and
then was extravagantly rebuilt in an act of
community resilience. The large and
impressively lovely Mediterranean and
Classic Revival style First United
Methodist Church, built in 1922, stops me
in my tracks. Elsewhere, the neon marquee
of the Grand Theatre, built in 1937, still
works, though the rest of the structure is
under renovation. Other buildings in
downtown Paris recall a gilded era but
retain the bones of prewar architecture.
Even the vacant storefronts are pretty.

A number of businesses wink at the Paris

called Sundae in Paris, the Olive Paris store
(sound it out). But others play it straight,
mostly—like Paris Grocery, which has
cheeses and wines from Texas, not France.

that say, “I Love Paris,” but where the heart
would normally be there’s the shape of
Texas.
Sonia buys one for me. “We’ll always have
Paris,” I say, mock-comically.
I get over my preconceptions and notice
signs of life. Young moms are hanging out
at the well-appointed yet relaxed Paris
Coffee Co. Teen girls in prom dresses are
having their pictures taken by the
Culbertson Fountain in the middle of the
plaza. There are even newspaper vending
machines filled with copies of The Paris
News, published since 1869. We’re too early
for the May dedication of a historical
marker commemorating the first Coca-
Cola sold in Texas, but we do get our photo
taken by the Dr Pepper mural honoring
the Paris chemist who perfected the
formula. Take that, France.
We’re having another picture taken by the
Grand Theatre marquee when we run into
Julia Trigg Crawford, executive director of
Keep Paris Beautiful “and the sign
changer-outter at the Grand.” She has just
completed the Don’t Mess with Texas
Trashoff, where she and about 300
volunteers picked up litter all morning.
Crawford says they had already tidied up
before the eclipse, when 10,000 people
visited to witness totality, including several
hundred from France. “Our town really is
clean right now,” she says.
Sonia asks Crawford about the dress code
for the evening. “Feel free to bling it out if

you want,” she says. “It’s see-and-be-seen.”
Sixteen years ago, the first thing we did
after landing in France was get a drink at
the Ritz and go to the Eiffel Tower. There
is no Ritz hotel in Paris, Texas, but there is
an Eiffel Tower—a 65-foot-tall replica built
in 1993. It’s in the parking lot of the Love
Civic Center, which is hosting a pop
culture convention featuring actors from
Return of the Jedi. It’s hard to confuse the
Texas replica with the French original. For
one, this one has a giant, red cowboy hat
on top.
“I would say it’s the most ridiculous thing
I’ve ever seen, but I’ve seen Little
Stonehenge,” Sonia says. As we gawk at it,
a man walks by dressed as a Jedi with a
lightsaber, also a replica. Few close
encounters of this kind occur at Little
Stonehenge, or in Paris, France, for that
matter. Later, Sonia admits the red cowboy
hat is “kinda cute.”
Apparently, there is no historical
consensus on how Paris, Texas, got its
name, but the version I like the best is this:
George W. Wright, a wealthy farmer,
donated the land for the town in 1844 and
chose to name it unseriously after the City
of Light. It was “in the spirit of fun,”
according to a contemporary account.
Paris, Texas, has always been in on the
joke.

The couple attends a tasting at the Paris,
Texas Wine Fest.
The VIP reception, called Fête du Vin, is
held under pink lights in a shabby-chic
prewar storefront. At the first of four
serving stations, a vivacious brunette with
bright blue eyes soldiers her way through
the description of a shallot gougère paired
with a 2022 chenin blanc. She’s tripping
over the name of the savory pastry, so
Sonia and I let her know it’s “goo-ZHERE.”
“Y’all just saved my day,” says Elizabeth
Zimmerman, who is co-owner of the wine
bar Vin de Paris, a stop on that evening’s
wine crawl. Zimmerman lights up when
we tell her why we’re visiting and invites us
back during Cinco de Mayo for a margarita
crawl.
At another station, jolly Walt Reep is
serving seared shrimp on toast paired with
a French rosé. He’s another co-owner of
Vin de Paris as well as Sundae in Paris, but
he seems especially proud of his Airbnbs.
“People drive hours out of their way to stay
there,” Reep says. “We should be the next
Fredericksburg.”

He calls the locals Parisites, not Parisians.
Reep is definitely in on the joke. So are a
crew of wine moms wearing “Sip Happens”
T-shirts at an upscale baby boutique called
Paris Baby, where we sample some of our
favorite wines of the evening from
Neighbors Place Winery in Bonham.
We end our night at Vin de Paris with
sparkling wine from Rowdy Creek Ranch
& Vineyard in Gilmer paired with a terrific
bread pudding from High Cotton Kitchen.
Sonia and I find stools at the bar. It’s
hopping. Sonia chit-chats with
Zimmerman while I meet her fiancé, a
lanky rock-climbing instructor and historic
restorationist named Andrew Turnbo.
They met when she was a student at the
University of Mary Hardin-Baylor and
working in a bar owned by his friend. The
first time he saw her she dropped a tray of
glasses. He was smitten. “That was it,” he
says. Turnbo glows when he talks about
her. “She was voted Best Bartender in
Lamar County in 2024!” he says.
Soon she moved in with him on his
restored sailboat. After school, she
suggested he move home to Paris with her.
“How could I say no? She lived on the
sailboat for six months,” Turnbo says.
The real reason he so readily agreed to
move to Paris had less to do with the town
than with Zimmerman. He’s a bit older
and had seen enough of the world that
when he met her, he could tell that she was
the kind of girl you go to Paris with. I
know how he feels.

Things to Do in Paris
Snap a selfie with a cowboy hat wearing Eiffel Tower, explore one-of-a-kind shops in a captivating 
downtown square (or anywhere else in Paris and across Lamar County), and take in all the fascinating local 
history. These are just a few of the adventures you just might have in the small town of 
. Located 
Paris, Texas
about 110 miles northeast of Dallas near the Texas-Oklahoma border, Paris is an ideal destination for those 
looking for a tranquil retreat from the hustle and bustle of the big city. With a downtown square full of 
interesting architecture, local shops and restaurants, as well as a variety of museums and historic sites, there’
s no shortage of things to do in Paris. So what are you waiting for? Continue reading to discover what this 
quaint North Texas town has to offer and plan your next road trip here today.
Visit the (Other) Eiffel Tower
France’s iconic landmark is a spectacular work of art 
and without question worthy of a trip halfway around 
the world. Yet you don’t need a passport to see 
Texas’ version of the Eiffel Tower, located right here 
in Paris next to the Love Civic Center.
One of the most notable Texas tourist attractions, the 
tower measures in at 65 feet tall once you’ve 
factored in the big, red cowboy hat that it’s wearing.
Stop by during daylight hours for a forced-
perspective photo of you “leaning” on the tower, or 
come by after dark to view it lit up by LED lights.
Take in the Local History
Paris has seen two major fires and a devastating 
tornado in its time, but the town has persevered 
through it all and even preserved much of its unique 
history. At the 
 
Lamar County Historical Museum
you can experience the city before and after the fire 
of 1916, from its notable people to reconstructed 
19th-century cabins, rooms, and workshops. 
Meanwhile, the Sam Bell Maxey House State 
 serves as a showcase of what life in the 
Historic Site
19th century was like for a prominent local family. 
The High Victorian Italianate house, built in 1868, 
was once home to Sam Bell Maxey, a Mexican War 
veteran, Confederate general, and two-term U.S. 
senator.
When he died, Mr. Maxey was laid to rest in Evergreen Cemetery. The cemetery is a popular spot for both 
history buffs and lovers of kitsch, as it’s the site of a 12-foot-tall statue of Jesus in cowboy boots. Other 
notable residents include a saloon owner who perished in a gunfight and cotton kingpin John J. Culbertson, 
for whom the downtown fountain is named.
Tour Paris’ Historic Downtown Square
Paris’ historic downtown square is the heart of this 
charming city. One-of-a-kind shops and restaurants 
reside within eye-catching historic storefronts, 
exuding an easy going small-town charm while also 
offering plenty to see and do.
Get your antiquing pleasures at stores like 
Remember When and Priest Emporium, or browse 
the chic offerings of one-of-a-kind shops like those 
at 
 and Olive Paris. To pick up a 
Green Boutique
beautiful painting or sculpture by a local artist, stop 
into the 
 any day but Sunday. 
Plaza Art Gallery
Finally, head over to the center of the square to see 
the Culbertson Fountain, a breathtaking Italian 
marble memorial to a local businessman.  
No doubt all this shopping and strolling will give you 
an appetite, and you don’t have to go far to find a 
great meal. 
 boasts baked goods and 
Paris Bakery
lighter fare, while 
 serves up a 
Jaxx Gourmet Burgers
unique range of burgers that you can pair with one of 
the many craft beers on tap. To experience dining at 
its finest, plan an evening dinner at Perry’s Off the 
Square to savor the creations of Master Chef Michael 
Perry. You could spend a full day experiencing all 
downtown Paris has to offer, and no two visits will 
ever be the same.  
Attend One of Paris’ Annual Events
One of the best ways you can enjoy a vacation to 
Paris is by checking out one of the city’s exciting 
annual events. If you’re a cycling enthusiast, it’s 
hard to beat the 
, when more than 1000 
Tour de Paris
cyclists converge on Paris to ride on one of six routes 
of varying length through the stunning North Texas 
countryside. The Tour now happens the same 
weekend in July as the 
, a 
Balloon and Music Festival
live music and hot air balloon extravaganza. 
Although they take place at the same time, it’s 
possible for you to enjoy both events.
Although the bike rally and balloon festival are must-
visit events in Paris, they’re by no means all that’s 
going on in town throughout the year. Some of the 
town’s annual events include the Wings Over Paris Air Show, Southern Drag Boat Race Association’s Paris 
Powerboat Grand Prix at Lake Crook, Paris Rodeo, Uncle Jesse Fishing Tournament, and the Chaparral 
Square Dancing on Labor Day Weekend. Also in September, the 
 includes a 
Paris Fair & Exposition
livestock show, plus carnival rides and food, live music, and more.

Paris is the county seat of Lamar County - the 1875 courthouse is show above. It is in the central part of
the county in the upland separating the tributaries of the Red and Sulphur rivers. The first recorded
settlement in the vicinity was in 1826, and settlements were known to be in the area as early as 1824.
The town was founded by merchant George W. Wright, who donated fifty acres of land in February 1844,
when the community was also designated the county seat by the voters. It was incorporated by the
Congress of the Republic of Texas on February 3, 1845. The community was named for Paris, France, by
one of Wright's employees, Thomas Poteet

History of Bywaters Park
The Corinthian Peristyle was designed by renowned Paris architect J.L. Wees in 1932.  The site of the
park and peristyle was built on the site of the Bywaters home that was destroyed in the Great Paris fire of
1916.  Bywaters donated the land, and J.J. Culbertson donated the peristyle.

Paris Texas Day Trip –
Visit the Other Eiffel
Tower
Published by on
The following is an adapted excerpt from Unexpected Texas,my fun travel
guide to quirky, offbeat and overlooked places near Dallas and Fort Worth.
Check it out if you are looking for fun road trips in north Texas. Also, for a

Why Take a Day Trip to Paris Texas?
While several Texan towns share names with European cities (London,
Athens, and Dublin to name a few) what makes Paris so special is how the
town plays up its French name, riffing on it like a jazz theme. As a result, Paris
Texas makes a fun day trip!

Eiffel Tower Replica
Take, for example, the Eiffel Tower replica built in the early 90’s with
volunteer parts and labor by a local factory, Babcock and Wilcox Co. Unlike
other replicas around the USA, Paris chose to add a touch of “yee haw” to
their “ooh-la-la” by topping their Eiffel Tower with a bright red cowboy hat.
Paris, TX Eiffel Tower Replica (photo by Tui Snider)
At a height of 65 feet, the replica is pretty teeny compared to the original
Eiffel Tower in that other Paris. Still, it’s much taller than anything nearby and
is mighty photogenic, as you can see from my photos.
Despite several signs around town, the Eiffel Tower replica can be a little hard
to find, so I’ve put the address in the trip summary at the end of this article.

Downtown Paris Texas: Antiques, Shopping and more
After taking some photos of the Eiffel Tower replica, set your GPS for
downtown, and get ready to do some walking. The citizens of Paris have kept
their little city in good shape.
Culbertson Fountain
A gorgeous marble fountain stands in the center of the historical downtown,
creating a lovely centerpiece for all the Mom and Pop stores surrounding it.
Paris makes a good Texas day trip for antique lovers. Nearly every store
downtown offers a free map listing at least 15 different antique shops within
walking distance of town square.

There is also a year-round farmer’s market near downtown where you can
enjoy what local growers have to offer. Sadly, the Paris Bakery was closed for
vacation when I made my day trip, but I’ve seen photos of their fresh pastries
and they look delicious. Next time!

Historic Neighborhoods and Architecture
Downtown Paris, Texas features older buildings with interesting details, such
as gargoyles and mosaic tiles. Don’t miss the Lamar County Courthouse, a
pink granite structure decorated with intricately carved columns, smug-faced
lions and other striking details.
The Historic Neighborhood of Paris, Texas is worth driving through to check
out all the lovely Victorian homes and wonderful old trees. One of these
historic homes, the Sam Bell Maxey House was recently remodeled and is
now open as a museum.

Jesus in Cowboy Boots (photo by Tui Snider)
Jesus in Cowboy Boots
No day trip to Paris, Texas is complete without a visit to Evergreen Cemetery,
where you can see a statue depicting Jesus wearing a pair of cowboy boots.
Tales abound regarding the Jesus in Cowboy Boots, which stands atop the
grave of a fellow named Willet Babcock. Some say it isn’t even supposed to be
Jesus, but an angel, instead.
Another rumor claims that the sculptor was bad at depicting feet, so he chose
cowboy boots in order to avoid the anatomical challenge. To see more photos
of this boot-clad Jesus, check out my post: Quirky Texas: Jesus in Cowboy

Trail de Paris
The Trail de Paris is a well-maintained public path for walking, jogging and
cycling. Not only is this lovely trail heavily-wooded, but the Valley of the
Caddo Star Gazer’s Club recently created a scale model of the solar system
along the way. As you can see from my photo, I made it all the way to Jupiter.

Big Soup Can in Paris, TX (photo by Tui Snider)
“Huge” Campbell Soup Can
While researching this Texas day trip, I heard about an allegedly “huge” can of
tomato soup on display in Paris. While it’s true that the entrance sign for the
local Campbell’s Soup factory does feature a big can of soup, I wouldn’t quite
call it huge. Still, it is worthy of a drive-by photo, especially if you are an Andy
Warhol fan.

THIS MEMORIAL WAS CREATED TO HONOR ALL VETERANS
Veterans who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our Country.
Veterans who served in war and peace but were fortunate enough to come back home.
Veterans who are currently serving our Country in the U.S. Armed Forces.
May it remind future generations and us that this freedom we enjoy is not free.  Our nation must be protected
from forces, both outside and within, that would deny us our liberty.

 Sam Bell Maxey House State Historic
Site
Sam Bell Maxey was a Mexican War veteran, former Confederate
general, and future U.S. Senator when his family moved into their
fashionable, newly built home on the south side of Paris in 1868. In
this home, the Maxey family navigated the political and social
landscape from Reconstruction Era Texas through the start of the
First World War. The home’s newly restored interiors showcase
original family furnishings, clothing, and letters. These give insight
into the lives of the three generations of the family that bore
witness to Reconstruction’s challenging legacy.

Weekend Road Trip to Paris, Texas
If you’re looking for fun Texas travel ideas, consider a road trip to Paris, Texas.
My husband and I recently drove there for an impromptu, “let’s get the hell
out of dodge,” weekend and had a great time. (To see the write up I did for
Discovering Dallas – Fort Worth, check out, Paris Texas Day Trip – Come See
the Other Eiffel Tower.
With only Sunday and Monday off, we couldn’t venture too far from our little
burg in the DFW region of north Texas. Our basic plan was to escape the crazy
heatwave we’re having this summer. A quick glance at a heat index map of the
USA, however, made it clear that there was no place within a day’s drive that
qualified as cool – and by ‘cool,’ I mean 85 degrees or less.

Even so, a change of scenery sounded fun. Last year, for instance, we took a
quick road trip to New Mexico, stopping in Roswell along the way. I wanted to
see the UFO museum there and whether or not the town openly embraces or
rejects its alien reputation. (Check out My Close Encounter with Roswell,
New Mexico if you’re curious. No alien sightings, but we did find a great Tex
Mex joint.)
This time around, when I asked my husband for road trip suggestions, he just
shrugged and said, “You’re the travel writer. Pick a place and we’ll go.”

Using Twitter for Road Trip Ideas
So I popped onto Twitter and asked for road trip ideas in the Dallas – Fort
Worth area. People came up with all sorts of  suggestions, and I even learned
about a new site called Mygola.com where you post travel questions such as
mine and get answers from regular folks. You’ve gotta love Twitter!
Glen Rose and Granbury were the Texan towns most often suggested for our
road trip, and while I love Granbury’s charming town square, and intend to
check out Glen Rose, Paris, Texas – which no one actually suggested – won
out in the end.

Why visit Paris, Texas?
So why, after all that great advice, did we end up in Paris? Simply put, the more
I researched the town, the more whimsical and endearing it sounded. For
instance:
The city built an Eiffel Tower Replica, which wears a bright red cowboy
hat on top.
The local cemetery features a statue in which Jesus is depicted
wearing cowboy boots.
The city’s walking/cycling trail, a.k.a. the Trail de Paris features a scale
replica of the solar system painted along the way.
According to online reviews the town has an excellent bakery.
I confess, it was those reviews of Paris Bakery that clinched it.  I had visions of
sitting at a shady sidewalk table, sipping espresso and nibbling a freshly baked
croissant – et voila! I had to make it happen.
I grabbed my traveling bag, tossed in my red beret, our toothbrushes, and –
this being Texas – some heavy duty sunscreen, then told my hubby, “Let’s
spend the weekend in Paris!”

Driving to Paris
It’s roughly a 4 hour drive from our little castle to Paris, Texas. I say “roughly”
because Google maps and our GPS did not agree. We had quite a tussel with
our GPS, in fact, who insisted that we drive through Dallas. How could we
convey to her linear AI mind that we were in the mood for picturesque back
roads and dusty little burgs? Ms. GPS was programmed for efficient Point A to
Point B journeys, after all, not leisurely road trip meandering.
We ignored her instructions, and drove in the opposite direction – away from
Dallas – as she repeatedly admonished us in her crisp British accent to, “Make
a U Turn, when possible.” Ms. GPS finally relented and sent us on a serpentine
route via dusty back roads. I could anthropomorphize even more, but I think
that route was the only one possible by then.

Downtown Paris, Texas
The mercury was flirting with 110 by the time we reached downtown Paris.
We parked in some shade by the main square which features a lovely marble
fountain donated to the city in 1927 by a rich fellow named Culbertson. The
fountain creates a beautiful centerpiece in old town Paris, and is rich with
detail.
Antique Shops and more…
Culbertson Fountain is flanked on all sides by interesting Mom and Pop
businesses, as well as a franchise or two, but only one place was open on
Sunday, a little antique shop on the corner called the Antique Mall.
When we returned Monday, a bunch of places were open including a health
food joint called Vital Beet, and a lively home interior shop called Spangler’s.
These Parisian venues are fun to explore, and the staff was friendly
everywhere we went. We spent most of our time wandering through antique
shops, following a little map which highlights 15 different ones, all within
walking distance of the Culbertson Fountain.  My favorite is called Priest’s

Emporium. It had the widest variety of items and included quirky vintage toys
as well as furniture and glassware.

Historic Architecture in Paris, Texas
Paris is one of those rare towns in America which resists looking like
“Anytown, USA” by actively cultivating its charms. Fans of Victorian
architecture will enjoy wandering through the Historic Neighborhood on
foot or by car. Paris is surprisingly lush, too. I admired all the big old trees as
much as I admired all the big old houses.
Most of these older houses are well kept, but some are rundown. Those
rundown ones spawned numerous daydreams of fixing them up, then inviting
my dearest friends to move in with me (kinda like Professor X did for the X
Men, y’know?) Most of these older homes are private residences, except for
the Sam Bell Maxey House, which is a museum. Unfortunately, as of this
writing, it is closed for remodeling.
Downtown Paris features old style buildings, one of which has gargoyles on
the corners, as you can see in my photos. I especially loved the Lamar County
Courthouse, which is a short walk from the town square. It’s a pink granite

building featuring ornate columns and other carved details such as smirking
lions.

Eiffel Tower Replica
By the time we reached, “the second largest Eiffel Tower in the world,” I was
overheated. My face turned blotchy and red, as if I’d been running, and I was
super thirsty. It was my own fault, though, since earlier, at the town square, I
turned up my nose at the idea of buying a drink at Subway.
Given the choice, I prefer to spend money at Mom and Pop places rather than
franchises. Trouble is, on a Sunday in a sleepy Texan town, one is not always
given the choice. I finally swallowed my pride (as well as several refills of iced
tea) at the local Dairy Queen.
As a result, I only snapped a couple quick photos of the Eiffel Tower Replica
that first afternoon. We returned the next morning, though, and I donned my
red wool beret and posed my heart out in front of the structure, wiping my
forehead between shots. Since it was already topping 100 degrees, I
instinctively stood in a shadow, which did not make  good photos. C’est la vie!

Jesus in Cowboy Boots
Next on our must-see-while-in-Paris list was the legendary Jesus in Cowboy
Boots located in Evergreen Cemetery. No one quite knows why the sculptor
chose such iconic footwear. Some say it was a compromise since the artist did
not know how to sculpt feet. Who knows?
For those who enjoy wandering through old graveyards, Evergreen Cemetery
is a real treat. I took a bunch of photos there, which I’ll share in another post,
since this one is already long and photo laden!

Trail de Paris Solar System Replica
The Valley of the Caddo Museum recently created a model solar system
along the Trail de Paris walking/cycling trail. It was too hot to walk the whole
trail, but we did find Jupiter, which is 4 inches in diameter. Elsewhere, they
have the sun at 42 inches round and, yes, they include Pluto, even though it is
a mere .07 inches in diameter at this scale.
Huge Campbell Soup Can
One rather anticlimatic item on our Paris, Texas sightseeing tour was the
allegedly “huge” Campbell Soup can. Turns out that it’s simply a larger than
life can of tomato soup attached to the sign at the entrance gate of the soup
factory.  It’s worth a drive-by, especially if you’re an Andy Warhol fan, but it is
certainly not a must-see.

Planning Your Trip to Paris, Texas
Here’s something I wish I could have found when I was researching Paris,
Texas as a road trip destination – a list of addresses for the main attractions to
plug into your GPS:
Culbertson Fountain in Historical Downtown Paris: The fountain is located
right across from the local Chamber of Commerce, 8 West Plaza, Paris, TX
75460
Evergreen Cemetery – Jesus in Cowboy Boots statue: Wander through the
older section of the cemetery until you see the grave marker for Willet
Babcock. Evergreen Cemetery, 560 Evergreen St, Paris, TX 75460
Eiffel Tower Replica: Located at Love Civic Center, 2025 South Collegiate
Drive, Paris, TX 75460
Trail de Paris: There are several trailheads. Look for a sign marking the one
at Noyes Stadium, 1245 24th Street, Paris, TX 75460
Sam Bell Maxey House: 812 South Church Street, Paris, TX 75460

Y’all Come Back
Paris is a friendly town, and business owners actually say, “Y’all come back,” as
you head out the door. I just may have to go back because the Paris Bakery,
the business that beckoned me from afar with promises of espresso and
pastries was closed for vacation during our visit! Not to mention that it is
really hard to wear a wool beret in triple digit heat.
Even so, I had fun and agree with the town slogan for Paris, Texas which
proclaims it to be, “A great place to hang your hat.” Of course, I doubt they had
a red wool beret in mind…

I actually live in Paris, TX and highly recommend the bakery! I believe the

Hi Di, Thanks for dropping by and leaving a comment. The info in

TEXAS. There are lots of really fun towns to explore in North Texas.
If you’re an architecture buff, you might also enjoy Jefferson,
Decatur, and – oh – don’t forget the Baker Hotel in Mineral Wells.

William Johnson McDonald, lawyer, banker, and philanthropist, eldest son of Henry Graham and Sarah
(Johnson) McDonald, was born on a farm near Howland, Texas, on December 21, 1844. He attended
McKenzie College, where Rev. John W. P. McKenzie was guardian of the orphaned William and his two
brothers. McDonald left college in 1864 to join the Confederate Army but returned when the war ended
and was graduated in 1867. He received a thorough classical training and developed a deep interest in
astronomy, botany, zoology, and geology.

made contributions to charity and helped a number of young men to get an education, and when his
fortune had become well assured, he traveled to Europe and Mexico, as well as to various points in the
United States. In 1895 and 1896 he studied botany in summer school at Harvard University.

received $800,000.

with a red cowboy hat.
Paris is famous for our iconic Eiffel Tower with the famous red cowboy hat.
What’s Paris without an Eiffel Tower?
Our tower was built in 1993 standing at 65 feet tall making it, at the time, the
largest in the country. When Las Vegas added their own Eiffel Tower to the
skyline we knew it was time to stand out amongst the crowd. In 1999, we added
the famous three-and-a-half-foot-tall red Stetson cowboy hat along with the
gold feather! At night, the tower lights up displaying the color of the Texas flag.
Our tower is one of our main tourist attractions with people travelling from
across the globe for the photo-op. The tower is open to the public 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week. While it’s a great place to visit on a road trip, a weekend
getaway, or if you’re just passing through… it has also become an icon for Paris,
Texas. You’ll notice a nod to the tower in our branding as well as many local
business logos, stickers, shirts and more.
Surrounding the tower you’ll find additional hot spots like the Red River Valley
Veterans Memorial, the Love Civic Center, the Paris Sports Complex, Pump
Track Paris, and the trailhead to Trail de Paris. The tower is located at 2025 S
Collegiate Dr, Paris, TX 75460, just off Loop 286.
City Parks
The City of Paris has more than 20 parks that offer a variety of features,
including playground equipment, pickle ball courts, volleyball, frisbee golf,
skating, walking trails and tracks, pavilions, and more. To see a comprehensive

Landmarks and Attractions
From local museums that bring history to life to monuments, statues,
downtown murals and more!
Of course, the Eiffel Tower is our most well-known landmark, but there’s more
to see than just the tower. The Red River Valley Veteran’s Memorial is said to be
among the best in the nation by those who have visited. In addition, due to the
Great Fire of 1916 and the abnormally fast rebuild of the City, we are proud to
have one of the largest collections of architecture from the years 1916-1920. Our
historic downtown is full of must-sees, from the murals and buildings, to
landmarks like the J.J. Culbertson Fountain in the heart of the city.

EIFFEL TOWER
Texas’s Eiffel Tower is a landmark in the city of Paris, Texas. The tower was constructed
in 1993. It is a model of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France
This replica was built in 1993, the same year as another one in the United States, the
Eiffel Tower in Paris, Tennessee. Original plans made the construction five feet taller
than the one in Tennessee and a cowboy hat added to the top, in a competitive spirit,
made the total height 65 feet.
It was built by members of the local welders’ union and is less than one tenth the
height of the 1,063-foot original. A shiny red cowboy hat was added to the top of the
spindle in 1998. The tower has 27 thirty-watt LED lights which are programmed by color

expectant couples revealing the sex of their babies, pink (for girls) or blue (for boys).
CULBERTSON FOUNTAIN
In the Center of the Square. A gift to the city by Paris businessman/ philanthropist J. J.
Culbertson, this Italian marble fountain was meant to commemorate the city’s rebirth
after the 1916 fire that destroyed most of the city. Designed by St. Louis architect J. L.
Wees, it is said that it was inspired by fountains the Culbertson family had seen while in
Italy. The fountain took three years to assemble (1924-1927).

The 1866 Evergreen Cemetery contains approximately 18,000 graves and features
carved headstones, including a 12-foot-tall statue of Jesus in cowboy boots. It is said
that the sculptor did not know how to sculpt sandals, so he went with boots instead.
Approximately 40,000 graves in Evergreen Cemetery, and the headstone of a small-
town furniture maker gets all the attention. Word of mouth brings people from near
and far just to find the grave they’ve heard so much about. They don’t know who’s
buried there, they just know what’s supposed to be standing over him. They want to
know if the rumors are true. They want to see the Jesus in the cowboy boots.
CHISUM GRAVE
John S. Chisum [1824-1884] was a Texas and New Mexico cattle baron. He was born in
Paris, Texas and was known for his participation in the Lincoln County War in New
Mexico and his friendship with Billy the Kid. A noted Texas historical figure, he is often
confused with the famous Texas cattleman Jesse Chisholm, namesake of the Chisholm
Trail. Before his death in Arkansas, John Chisum requested to be buried back in Paris
and this small memorial park southwest of downtown is the site of the family cemetery.
A nice grave memorial rests here with simple landscaping, a curved drive, and a Texas
Historical Marker. An interesting stop for Texas History buffs.

SAM BELL MAXEY HOUSE
The Sam Bell Maxey House is a historic house in Paris, Lamar County, Texas. Samuel
Bell Maxey, a prominent local attorney and later two-term U.S. senator, built the large
two-story house after serving as a major general in the Confederate Army. It is built in
the High Victorian Italianate style.
From 1868 to 1966, the house was the home of Samuel B. Maxey and his family. It was
added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Lamar County, Texas on
March 18, 1971. The house was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1962.
Restoration was completed September 1, 1980, and it was opened to the public on a
tour basis. On January 1, 2008, the house was transferred from the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department to the Texas Historical Commission and is now operated at
the Sam Bell Maxey House State Historic Site.

This memorial is being built to honor all Veterans who have served our country in the
past and are currently serving in our military. This impressive memorial is located in
Paris, Texas next to the Eiffel Tower at the Love Civic Center.  The Memorial’s centerpiece
is the Ring of Honor, an elevated ring of granite walls containing the names of all men
and women from the five-county Red River Valley area who made the ultimate sacrifice
in a combat zone while in service to our country.  Surrounding the Ring of Honor will be
double-sided granite Conflict Walls etched with information and graphic depictions of
each war or conflict beginning with the Texas Revolution up to the present war with
Global War on Terror, with room for depictions of future conflicts.
Leading up to and surrounding the Ring of Honor will be walkways with 1’ x 2’ granite
pavers engraved with the names of the men and women who served and were
fortunate to return home, or those who are currently serving our country.
The Red River Valley Veterans Memorial will be a place for reflection, remembrance and
gratitude.  It is our hope that this will also be a place to educate present and future
generations of the sacrifice made by a member of their own family and their
community to secure the freedoms we all enjoy.  And may it be a reminder
that “Freedom Is Not Free.”
TRAIL DE PARIS
The Trail de Paris runs for just over 3 miles from the town of Paris east into the
countryside. The paved route follows a lovely corridor of shade trees, crossing bridges as
it heads along a former railroad right-of-way. The trail includes benches, viewing
platforms, mile markers, and interpretive signs. It offers access to a butterfly garden,
junior college, neighborhoods, and parks.

"2024- Yelp 100 Challenge - #50 If you're in the
area, I recommend stopping in for a photo
opportunity and to check out the Veterans
Memorial. The memorial is located beside the
Eiffel Tower, so it is a nice rest break. Fun Fact
this location is open 24 hours and light up at
night showing the colors of the Texas Flag."

This is an excellent memorial to our military. We visited it at night and enjoyed the solitude and peace. We
stayed no more than 20 minutes and that was plenty of time.
What a clever idea fo

THE BEST THINGS TO DO
IN PARIS TEXAS WITH
YOUR SWEETHEART
1. Love Civic Center at
Night 
Love Civic Center in Paris Tx is only 6 minutes drive from the
historic downtown square and home to not just the  Civic
Conference Center itself, but also the Paris Eiffel Tower and
the Red River Veterans Memorial. No doubt one of the first
stops for visitors of this lovely town, not many may think to
visit at night. but it's one of the best and most memorable
experiences in the city. There is something about seeing the
lights at night, taking a stroll and reflecting on the history

It goes without saying that the Paris TX Eiffell tower is a must
see. Built in 1993, it stands 65 feet tall and YES - it has a red,
cowboys hat. Welcome to Texas Y'all! 
Since our visit was during December the flowers and trees
were not in bloom but the area was still beautiful for photos.
Texas winters are mostly mild, which means you can have a

picnic most months during the year and this spot is perfect
for a picnic with a significant other or the family.
The tower is officially located at 2025 S Collegiate Dr. but you
can also drive to the Love Civic Center address (which was
easy to find). Entry is free year round and at night it is
illuminated in the colors of the American flag. When we
visited in the morning it was not crowded, but there were a
few couples and groups visiting. I wouldn't think it gets
awfully crowded during the day but an early morning visit may
be safer in order to avoid the crowds.

I love history and research, so I had seen pictures of the Red
Rivel Valley Veterans Memorial, but let me tell you. None of
them do it justice. Make sure you give yourself enough time to
really see and appreciate it. I was frankly suprised at how
much there was to see past the gate featured on most photos.
Walk through to find the Ring Of Honor, which features the US
Flag in the center that flies 24/7 - 365 days in the year. The
comemorative pannels include the names of soldies from 4 TX
counties and one Oclahoma county killed in action during
WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Korean and War on Terror.

The memorial is also home to the War Dog Monument and the
Gold Star Monument, so deffinitely look for those. You will not
want to miss them. The sheer grandure of the memorial, the
sound of the flags waving in the wind, the lights at night all
made it one of my favorite spots in town. I could have spent a
lot more time there and can't wait to visit again. 
4. Paris TX Historic
Town Square
The heart of the town is without a doubt its Historic Town
Square. Paris Texas is Always a Good Idea the slogan reads and
indeed it is for so many reasons. Home to adorable boutique
shops, quite a few antique stores, indoor and outdoor dining,
and parks there is something for everyone. The best part is
that it is extremely walkable and there was enough to keep us
entertained for hours. 
The town hosts quite a few seasonal events and festivals, that
would make for an even more memorable getaway. Those
including a local Farmers and Artisan Market May through

The historic Cubertson fountain is located in the center of
Paris Tx town square and is quite the site both during the day
and at night. A gift to the city in 1923 by philanthropist J. J.
Culbertson, this Italian marble fountain commemorates the
city’s rebirth after the devastating fire of 1916.

Freshly baked goods in the morning, artisan breads and
comforting hot drinks are the perfect way to start a day. Paris
Bakery is right on top of our list of the best things to do in
Paris Texas. We drove to Pat Macy lake in after we woke up so
we got to the bakery around 9:30am and I am sorry to tell you
that we were too late. They still have a couple of muffins and a
savory artisan bread we bought to take with us home, but
most of the pastires were already sold out.

The place is no doubt a hit for locals and visitors alike, so
make sure you get there early to enjoy the best selection of
their sweet and savory creations. Bonus points for serving hot
herbal tea with lemon and honey. The ambiance is very
relaxing, the decor is quite nice and the baked goods are out
of this world. A MUST try! Don't forget your bread to go. You
will thank me later.

How about a night at the theater? And not just anywhere but
the historic Plaza Theater, home of Paris Community Theatre.
When the Plaza was first opened in the summer of 1926 it was
"the last word in a picture show house.” From the architecture
with it's rounded arches, tiled roof, and ornate foyer to the
elegant interior decor in shades of tan, ivory and antique gold
accented by the rose colored stage curtain.
Since it's opening night almost a century ago, the unique
flashing PLAZA sign has lit up the square welcoming visitors.

Home to the PARIS COMMUNITY THEATRE since 1976 it
continues to offer quality entertainment for the community.
Talk about the ideal date! As if steping back in time this
impressive Art Deco-style building is not just an a place to
stop by and take a photo with (although it really is quite
instagrammable). The theater is so much more than that. It is
history come to life. It is an experience.

If you have ever been to an oilery you know that a stop at
Olive Paris is a must. If not, you are in for a treat. Since I grew
up on a Mediterrenian diet, olive oils and vinegars are a staple
in our home kitchen, so I make sure that I try local stores
featureing oils, vinegars and spices whenever we travel. That
said, I have visited many such shops but Olive Paris quite
literary took my breath away.

In addition to a great selection of oils and balsamics, Olive
Paris carries a lot of sauces, pickles, spices, syrups and even
honey. They also offer a unique selection of summer sausages,

charcuterrie basket and go for a picnic by the Paris TX Eiffel

Remember When Collectibles shop. Located right on the
historic square this antiques and vintage store has a fantastic
selection of items organized by theme in different rooms. Very
accessable, the isles are quite large as to accomodate baby
strollers or wheel chairs. If you are looking for comic book

More so than the treasures it offers, Remember When is a
treasure in itself. A family business, this lovely shop is a big
part of what made us fall in love with the city of Paris TX, its
history and most importantly the community. A historic photo
is hung right by the door showing the town square as it was
decades ago.
The building of where the store is located today, the Plaza
Theater, the fountain in the center and of course the cars
from back in the day. You feel the heart of a city that rebuilt

Tuesday through Sunday and guided tours available by

The home is newly restored showcasing original family
furnishings, clothing, and other items. In addition to the tours
I was pleasantly surprised to see that they offer fun events
throughout the year like Vintage Valentine's Workshop where
you get to make your own Victorian-style Valentine and Build

starting at the Capital One Bank Building and ending at the
Culbertson Fountain.
One of my favorite stops on the list is First United Methodist
Church - a historic church  built in 1922. The building's
architecture is truly striking. Indiana limestone, tile dome
with a case copper crown and an inner dome that covers a
beautiful 12 section stained glass. This impresive building was
included in the National Register of Historic Places and is
worth visiting.

Drop by the Antique Mall in Paris, Texas for a great selection
of vintage and antique items. We filled up the trunk with
treasures I had not been able to find elsewhere. This is a very
big store and a great spot to walk around.

To be honest we didn't know about the Downtown Community
Park, so it was not on our lists of things to do in Paris Texas.
We were driving by and happened to see it and had to pull
over. What a lovely park it is. If it is not on your list it
definitely should be.

Jaxx Bergers is a must try restaurant when in town. A
FANTASTIC selection of mouth watering burgers, chicken fried

Dinner at 107 was fantastic. The service equally so. In the
evening the ambiance is lovely, so we really enjoyed our time.
107 is a restaurant and beer garden, so it offers both indoor
and outdoor seating. The menu has a lot of selections and
everything we ordered was cooked to perfection.

They offer some really unique items on the menu like Sashimi
Nachos, a  great selection of sliders, burgers, tacos, and
grilled cheese sandwitches, pasta and even flatbreads.
Awsome appetizers and quite a few salad options. I loved the
cranberry walnut salad. When it comes to desert the fried
cheesecake was the best!

20. Pat Mayse Lake
The drive up to Pat Macy lake early in the morning was
definitely worth it even though when we visited it was quite
cloudy.  Visit for a picnic, camping, fishing, viewing the wild
life or simply for a nice walk. The lake is also on the way to the
Chocataw Casino in Grant Oclahoma, located only 15 minutes
from downtown Paris, TX.

The Chocataw Casino & Resort in Grant Oclahoma is just a
short 15 minutes drive from Paris, TX and it does offer live
entertainment, dining, gaming, cove bar, and hotel onsite with
a pool. It is open 24/7 so if you are in the mood for a late
night out it's certainly a good option for a date. As we drove
from Pat Mayse lake up to Grant, I loved crossing the Texas -
Oclahoma border. It really is a beautiful country and makes for
a great drive, especially during sunset.

While there is so much to do and see in Paris, Texas, you will
not regret taking some time to watch the sunset. Drive
through East Texas, just a few minutes from town, and take in
the beauty of the setting sun.

There are quite a few lodging options both in town and the
nearby. We rented a lovely home just ouside of town equiped
with a kitchen, living room, two bedrooms and full bath. If you
are looking for a nice place to stay in town, one of our
favorites are the 1st Steet Lofts. Beautiful apartments offering
modern luxury in historic Paris, TX.
