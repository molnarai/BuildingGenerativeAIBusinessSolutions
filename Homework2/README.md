# Instructions for Homework 2:

- After logging in to the new IFI cluster git clone the repo to your home directory via:

  **git clone git@github.com:molnarai/BuildingGenerativeAIBusinessSolutions.git**

- Use the **MSA8700 Python 3.12** kernel! This kernel has all the necessary Python packages already installed. You do not have to install any packages. Do **NOT** use any of the other kernels. 

- In a terminal run **cd BuildingGenerativeAIBusinessSolutions**.

- Then run **cd Homework2**. 

- Make a copy of the homework notebook and rename the copy using your GSU username as suffix:

    **AgenticAI_RAG_Homework2_<YOUR GSU USERNAME>.ipynb**

- Work with your renamed copy to create your solution and all the necessary .txt files that will be generated and submitted with your notebook. 

- Complete all cells in the notebook i.e. replace nmissing fiekds with your code cells, run the notebook and create the 6 necessary .txt files. Run the tests to confirm that your .txt files were generated. Finally, submit your .txt files by running the submission script at the very end.
