Knowledge graphs are powerful data structures that represent information as a network of interconnected entities and relationships. Unlike traditional databases, knowledge graphs store data in a way that mimics human-like understanding of concepts and their associations. At their core, knowledge graphs consist of nodes (representing entities) and edges (representing relationships between entities), forming a flexible and intuitive representation of complex information.

In the context of LLMs and artificial intelligence, knowledge graphs serve as a bridge between unstructured data and machine-readable formats. They excel at capturing the nuanced connections within large datasets, making them particularly valuable for tasks that require reasoning across multiple pieces of information.
