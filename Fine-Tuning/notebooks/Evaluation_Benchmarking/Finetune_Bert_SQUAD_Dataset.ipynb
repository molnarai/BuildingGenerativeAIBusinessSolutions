        "In this Notebook, we fine-tune [BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) for Question Answering (Q&A) tasks using the [SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/explore/1.1/dev/Super_Bowl_50.html) dataset. Developed by Google in 2018, BERT revolutionized the field of NLP by setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks across various NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "BERT is pre-trained on a massive corpus, allowing it to grasp language structure and context. This pre-trained model can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks such as sentiment analysis or question answering. Fine-tuning BERT for Q&A tasks involves adjusting the model to predict the start and end positions of the answer in a given passage for a provided question (extractive question answering). The following steps outline the process of fine-tuning BERT for these tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **ðŸŒ± Dataset Preparation**:\n",
        "    - Define each dataset item with a question, a passage (or context), and the start and end positions of the answer within the passage as the label.\n",
        "    - Tokenize both the question and passage into subwords using BERT's tokenizer. Separate the question from the passage using the `[SEP]` token and start the input sequence with the `[CLS]`\n",
        "      token.\n",
        "    - Mark the question as segment `A` (or `0`) and the context as segment `B` (or `1`). Use this information to learn different embeddings for each segment, which are added to the word\n",
        "      embeddings.\n",
        "1. **ðŸª¡ Model Modification**:\n",
        "    - Extract embeddings for each token in the sequence from the pre-trained BERT model.\n",
        "    - Add a dense (fully connected) layer on top of BERT, with two output nodes: one for predicting the start position and one for predicting the end position of the answer in the passage (see\n",
        "      [code](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/c385de24414e4ec6125ee14c46c128bfe70ecb66/src/transformers/models/bert/modeling_bert.py#L1803)).\n",
        "1. **ðŸŽ¯ Training Objective**:\n",
        "    - Output a score for each token in the passage, indicating how likely that token is the start of the answer, and another score for the end.\n",
        "    - Apply a SoftMax function over the sequence to get a probability distribution for the start and end positions.\n",
        "    - Use the sum of the negative log likelihood of the correct start and end positions as the loss function.\n",
        "1. **ðŸš€ Training**:\n",
        "    - Initialize training with pre-trained BERT weights.\n",
        "    - Apply a smaller learning rate (e.g., 2e-5 or 3e-5) since BERT is already pre-trained. Avoid using a larger learning rate, as it may cause the model to diverge.\n",
        "    - Fine-tune the model on the Q&A dataset for several epochs, stopping when validation performance plateaus or decreases.\n",
        "1. **âœ¨ Inference**:\n",
        "    - Tokenize a new question and passage, and add the special `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens.\n",
        "    - Feed the tokens into the fine-tuned BERT model to get scores for the start and end positions of the answer.\n",
        "    - Select the tokens between the predicted start and end positions as the final answer.\n",
        "    - Apply constraints such as ensuring the end position is after the start and limiting the maximum answer length.\n",
        "1. **ðŸŽ‰ Evaluation**:\n",
        "    - Measure performance using common metrics like Exact Match (EM), which calculates the percentage of predictions that exactly match the ground truth and the F1 score to account for partial\n",
        "      matches by considering overlapping words between the prediction and ground truth.\n",
